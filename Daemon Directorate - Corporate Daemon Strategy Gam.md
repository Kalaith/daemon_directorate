# Daemon Directorate - Corporate Daemon Strategy Game

I've created a fully functional web-based strategy game based on your detailed design document. **Daemon Directorate** captures the dark corporate satire and strategic depth you outlined, featuring finite daemon lifespans, planetary conquest, and apartment HQ management.

## Core Systems Implemented

**Team Management**: Your daemon operatives have unique specializations, quirks, and limited lifespans measured in days. When they die, successors can inherit some equipment, creating a generational legacy system.[^1][^2][^3][^4]

**Planetary Conquest**: Choose from planets with varying difficulty levels and resistance types. Mission success depends on team composition and equipment, with rewards of credits and specialized resources.[^5][^6]

**Apartment HQ**: Upgrade rooms like Training Halls, Recovery Wards, and Item Forges to provide ongoing bonuses. Each room can be enhanced using resources from conquered planets.[^7][^8][^9]

**Item Degradation**: Equipment provides powerful abilities but degrades with each use. Rare items force strategic decisions about when to use them versus preserving them.[^10][^11][^12]

**Corporate Satire**: The game features corporate-speak mission briefings, bureaucratic events like "Performance Reviews" and "Budget Cuts," and daemon operatives with workplace personality quirks.[^13][^1]

The game emphasizes the tension between ambition and loss that defines your design - every success has a cost, and players must build sustainable daemon dynasties while accepting inevitable turnover. The corporate office aesthetic and infernal bureaucracy theme permeate every aspect of the interface and gameplay.

Players start with three basic daemon operatives and must strategically manage their finite lifespans while expanding their corporate hellscape empire across multiple planets. Success isn't measured by infinite growth, but by how memorable your daemon dynasty becomes before corporate restructuring claims it all.
